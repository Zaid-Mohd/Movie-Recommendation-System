# Movie-Recommendation-System

This guided project is designed to provide users with personalized movie suggestions based on their preferences. The system utilizes a content-based filtering algorithm and a dataset of 5000 movies from Kaggle to generate recommendations. The text data from the dataset, including information about the movies and credits such as movie id , title , genre, director, actors, etc.

The content-based filtering algorithm takes user preferences into consideration by providing movie name. These preference are then used to make recommendations based on the content of the movies themselves.

The implementation of the project was guided by the CampusX YouTube channel and is in Python, leveraging the scikit-learn library for machine learning. The text vectorization technique was used to convert the text data of tags that are created from the movie dataset into numerical vectors that can be used as input for the content-based filtering algorithm.

The project is designed to provide users with a personalized and enjoyable movie-watching experience by making tailored suggestions based solely on the content of the movies. The system takes the movie name as input from the user and recommends the top 5 most similar movies of interest.
